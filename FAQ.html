        <p><b>What is Anthony Nolan?</b></p>
        <p>
        You must be aged 16-39 and meet our medical criteria (general good health).
        </p>
        <p><b>Once I've given a sample, is that it?</b></p>
        <p>
        This is the first step towards potentially saving someones life. If you come up as a possible match we'll contact you to explain
            what happens next.
        </p>
        <p><b>iI'm 31 and healthy. Why can't I join the register?</b></p>
        <p>
            Donors between the ages of 16-30 are far more likely to be chosen by hospitals to go ahead for transplant. We have limited funds
            and resources, so we need to focus on recruiting people who have the best possible chance of being chosen to donate.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you'd like to help our work in some other way, we'd be incredibly grateful. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.anthonynolan.org/8-ways">anthonynolan.org/8-ways</a>
        </p>
        <p><b>Is the procedure painful?</b></p>
        <p>
            90% of our donors now give their stem cells via the bloodstream. It's a simple, painless process, very similar to giving blood.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you give your bone marrow, you'll be under anaesthetic. Afterwards you'll probably feel a bit tired and bruised, and you might
            have to take a little time off work. That's all.

                        <p>
                            You go to a specialised hospital and have some tests done - blood tests, a chest x-ray, that sort of thing. A week
                            later, we'll call to say the tests are fine, and then send you details about things like dates, hotels and
                            transportation.

                        <p>
                            You'll receive a four day course of injections that stimulate your body to produce stem cells. A nurse comes to
                            your office or home to give you the injections. You'll probably notice your bones aching a little. Don't worry,
                            its totally normal.

                            The next morning, you'll head over to the hospital.

                        <p>
                            Now you're ready to donate. You're connected to a machine which takes blood from one arm, filters out the stem
                            cells, and returns your blood to the other arm. The process takes four to five hours. It can get a bit boring,
                            so you might want to watch telly or chat to your companion. If there are enough stem cells - and there usually are - you can go home.
                            If not we need you to have another injection and return the next day for another session on the machine.

                        <p>
                            After your big day you'll probably feel tired and might experience some flu-like symptoms. These always pass
                            after a few days. Get plenty of well-deserved rest and you'll soon be feeling right as rain

                            Your stem cells are the things which are missing from the person you're a match for. Yours will kick-start
                            there system into action and help them recover from a very vulnerable state. You've potentially saved a life.

                            In the morning, you'll be given a general anaesthetic. During a short procedure - about 30 minutes - you'll lie
                            on your front and bone marrow is taken from your pelvic bone using a needle and syringe. You won't need
                            stitches after the procedure but you'll have two plasters where the bone marrow was taken from. People think
                            donating bone marrow is really painful, but donors tell us that it's not any worse than how you'd feel after
                            a heavy workout in the gym
